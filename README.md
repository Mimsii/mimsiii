Problem-solver, analytical thinker, perfectionist, who desires to progress and to become an experienced Software Developer and a valuable Team Member.
I'm currently on my journey of studying Software Development.
So far I'm familiar with Python, C++, Algorithms and Data Structures with C++, SQL, C#, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, .NET Framework, HTML & CSS, Angular, React, but I'm always adding a new skill to my repertoire.
More precisely I'm more into back end programming.
